# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Building <head>
1. Placing  <head> structure with meta data and links: 
- webpage name on a browser's tab (<title>)
- Bootstrap core CSS
- my CSS file
- custom icons from Font Awesome if I decide to use some


## Building <body> 
1. Placing Bootstrap Navigation bar 
- HTML: deactivated button - not needed now, but maybe in the future
- HTML: logo, decorative lettering and text for menu  added
- CSS: navbar-nav rearranged to have logo and subtitle on the left- & menu on the right-hand side
- CSS: navbar made as white and forced (by !important as I could not do it without it)
- CSS: logo defined as 200ph width and having padding from right-hand side txt=20px

2. Placing jumbotron for the main 'welcoming' img
- HTML: sub-class 'jumboTwo' used as the nested part 
- CSS: while inspecting the result in the browser some text's look and button colours were amended

3. Placing cards to showcase jobs - one card for each presented project
- adding 20px margin from top
- linked contextual imgs from the folder
- leaving buttons - the will lead to the linked webpages presentong projects
- SKILLSET - card used to create a simple listing

4. Contact section
- HTML: experimenting with placeholders a bit

5. Footer - links added the same as in the navbar

6. Buttons - shadow added in CSS
